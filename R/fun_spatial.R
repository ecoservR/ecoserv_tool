#' Faster Intersection by Indexing
#'
#' This function performs a spatial intersection, but first performs a check to identify only the features that need clipping. Features completely outside the boundary are discarded, and those completely inside are kept as is.

#' @param x a simple features object
#' @param cliplayer The layer used for clipping, also a simple features object
#' @return A sf object clipped to the desired boundary
#' @export

faster_intersect <- function(x, cliplayer){

   x <- checkcrs(x, cliplayer)  # check that crs is same and otherwise change it

   test <- sf::st_intersects(x, sf::st_geometry(cliplayer)) # test if polygons overlap clipping layer


   # if result is empty (o: FALSE), out of study area, we delete

   x <- x[lengths(test) > 0,]  # exclude polygons that don't even intersect

   if (nrow(x) > 0) { # only if there are polygons left:

      # now we check which polygons are fully within as we don't need to clip them at all
      test2 <- sf::st_covered_by(x, sf::st_geometry(cliplayer))

      # and we intersect the rest

      cut <- x[lengths(test2) == 0,]  # extract objects to cut
      x <- x[lengths(test2) != 0,]  # and remove them from main object

      # perform the intersection
      cut <- suppressWarnings(
         sf::st_intersection(cut, sf::st_geometry(cliplayer))

#' Functional Threshold
#'
#' Create a mask to remove small patches not considered to provide a service. Used in some ecosystem service capacity models. Not meant to be used directly.

#' @param x a capacity score raster
#' @param local the wide search radius, in meters (defaults to 0 in case it doesn't apply to model)
#' @param res the resolution of the raster (m)
#' @param proportion the proportion of cells in the search radius which we allow to have a low score (10 units) and still consider 0
#' @param threshold the size threshold (m2) for a patch to be considered functional
#' @return the score raster, masked
#' @export

functionalMask <- function(x, local = 0, res, proportion = 0.10, threshold){

### Create the score value up to which we consider a cell to have no capacity
   # This is because in some models, the search radius is so big that it's almost
   # impossible to have a cell of score 0; but a very low score doesn't mean
   # the service is really provided

   # Therefore we allow "proportion" of cells to have a score of 10 within the area of the circle with "local" radius (number of cells in that circle depends on "res")

   minscore <- (pi*local^2)/(res^2)*proportion*10   # if a given model doesn't do focal stats, then having "local" set to 0 will create a minscore of 0, which is what we want


   ### Create a binary score raster (NA: no capacity / 1: some capacity)
   score_bin <- x  # create a copy of the score raster
   score_bin[score_bin <= minscore] <- NA # everything that has a score representing no (or virtually no) capacity gets assigned NA (faster for next steps)
   score_bin[score_bin > minscore] <- 1 # the rest has some capacity, so given value of 1

   ### Create the patch raster that will form the mask

   patch <- landscapemetrics::get_patches(score_bin,  # Identifying raster "clumps" (groups of connected pixels that are not NA)
                        class = 1,  # the value we assigned to patches
                        directions = 8,  # looking for neighbouring cells in all 8 directions
                        return_raster = TRUE)[[1]][[1]]  #[[1]][[1]] extracts the raster from the (nested) list (bug fix for landscapemetrics 1.5.3)

   patch <- raster::raster(patch) # fix as landscapemetrics now returns terra Spatrasters

   # Calculate area of each patch, creating an index of which ID need to be removed

   remove <- landscapemetrics::lsm_p_area(score_bin) %>%  # calculate area of every patch (in hectares)
      dplyr::mutate(value = as.numeric(value*10000)) %>%   # transform to meters squared
      dplyr::filter(value < threshold) %>%  # retain patches under the size threshold
      dplyr::select(id)  # keep only their id

   rm(score_bin)  # remove no longer needed objects to free up memory

   # create the mask by removing offending patches

   if (nrow(remove) > 0){
   # turn the ID number flags of small patches into NA (no patch)
   patch <- raster::subs(patch,
                         data.frame(id = remove$id,
                                    newval = NA),
                         which = 2, subsWithNA = FALSE)
   }

   # mask areas of 0 value
   x <- raster::mask(x, patch, maskvalue = NA)  # every NA

   ## Avoiding raster-specific use of brackets for subsetting as doesn't always work within package (use named function isntead)
   #x[is.na(x) == TRUE] <- 0  # the masked areas get value of NA, but we want 0

   x <- raster::reclassify(x, cbind(NA, NA, 0), right=FALSE)

   return(x)

   on.exit(rm(patch, remove))

# Function to set a max search distance in a raster before a distance analysis ----------------
